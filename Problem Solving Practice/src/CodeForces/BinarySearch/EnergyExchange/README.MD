Input:
- Energy can be transferred between accumulators:
    - if x units are transferred -> k percent is lost
- n in 1..10 000: number of accumulators
- k in 0..99: percent of lost energy
- n integers: amount of energy in accumulator

Output:
- Maximum possible amount of energy that can remain of each accumulator
- The absolute or relative error not exceed 10^-6

Example:
Input:
3 50
4 2 1

Output:
2.000000000

Observation:
