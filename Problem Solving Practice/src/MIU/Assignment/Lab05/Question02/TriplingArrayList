k = 9, now I can add 6 new items
Cost of adding 6 item: 6
Cost of resizing: 3k + k = 4k = 36
Total cost: 6 + 36 = 42
Amortized cost: 42 / 6 = 7

Actual cost of adding: 1
Actual cost of resizing: 3k
Traditional analysis: If have n operation
    - Cost of each resizing: 4n
    - Worst case: every operation could be resizing
        -> total cost = 4n * n = 4 * n^2
    -> BigO = 4 * n^2 / n = 4n = O(n)
Amortized analysis: If have n operation
    - Total cost: 7n
    -> Big O = 7n / n = 7 = O(1)
