- For each test case:
    - m, n: number of row and column in maze
    - M[i][j]:
        - '#': wall
        - '.': space
- Valid maze:

- The maze is valid or invalid

Example:

####
#...
#.##
#.##

Observation:
- Consider each M[i][j] as a node of graph
- Entry point or Exit Point: from rear edge: i or j = 0
- Path from point X to point Y: All spaces without wall.
