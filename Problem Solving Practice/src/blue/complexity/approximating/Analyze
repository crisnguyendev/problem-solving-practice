Input:
- n  in 2..100 000: number of data points
- a1, a2, .. an in 1..100 000: sequence of data point
- for each i in 1..n: | a(i +1) - a(i) | <= 1
- range [l, r] is almost constant range if:
    - M: maximum of ai, i in l..r
    - m: minimum of ai, i in l..r
    - M - m <= 1

Output:
- Maximum length of almost constant range of given sequence

Example:
Input:
5
1 2 3 3 2

Output:
4

Observation:
- Maximum length of almost constant range is: n
- Minimum length of almost constant range is: 2
- For each ai:
    - Could be starting point (l) of new almost constant range
    - Could belong to one of previous almost constant ranges
    - Could be ending point (l) of previous almost constant ranges
- Maximum of distinct number in almost constant range is 2
    - If still keep maximum of distinct number <= 2: extend range
    - When see 3rd distinct number -> Stop almost constant range
